**GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR FEATURE SELECTION**

**Introduction**
In many machine learning tasks, feature selection plays a crucial role in improving model performance, reducing overfitting, and enhancing interpretability. This GA-based approach automates the process of selecting the most relevant features from a given dataset, thereby optimizing the neural network model's accuracy.

**Steps Performed**
1. Data pre-processing
2. Defining a neural network model with cross-entropy loss function
3. Applying Genetic algorithm
4. Feature selection and model evaluation

**Detailed Description:**

**Data Pre-processing**
The code initially loads data from CSV files containing audio features related to emotions. Only data corresponding to 'happy' and 'sad' emotions with specific intensity levels and actor ranges are considered. Irrelevant columns are removed, and the modified data is saved in a designated output folder.

**Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithm**
**1. Chromosome Representation**
In the GA, each chromosome represents a binary string where each bit corresponds to a feature column in the dataset. A value of 1 indicates the inclusion of the feature, while 0 indicates exclusion.

**2. Genetic Operators**
**2.1. Fitness Evaluation:** The fitness of each chromosome is evaluated using a basic neural network model. The accuracy of the model serves as the fitness score.

**2.2. Selection:** Roulette Wheel Selection is employed to select chromosomes for reproduction based on their fitness scores. Chromosomes with higher fitness have a greater chance of being selected.

**2.3. Crossover:** Single-point crossover is applied to selected chromosomes. A random crossover point is chosen, and the subsequences of two parent chromosomes are swapped to produce offspring.

**2.4. Mutation:** Mutation introduces diversity into the population by randomly flipping bits in the chromosome with a predefined mutation rate.

**Model Training**
A neural network model is trained using the selected features. The model consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation, followed by a softmax output layer. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set.

**Performance Evaluation**
The GA iterates through multiple generations, optimizing feature selection for improved model accuracy. After the specified number of generations, the best-performing chromosome and its corresponding accuracy are reported.

**Analysis**
The impact of feature selection on model performance is significant, as demonstrated by the increase in accuracy achieved through the GA optimization process. By iteratively selecting relevant features, the GA enhances the discriminatory power of the neural network model.
