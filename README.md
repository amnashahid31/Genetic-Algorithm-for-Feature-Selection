**Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection**

**Introduction**
In many machine learning tasks, feature selection plays a crucial role in improving model performance, reducing overfitting, and enhancing interpretability. This GA-based approach automates the process of selecting the most relevant features from a given dataset, thereby optimizing the neural network model's accuracy.

**Steps Performed**
1. Data pre-processing
2. Defining a neural network model with cross-entropy loss function
3. Applying Genetic algorithm
4. Feature selection and model evaluation
